"""Payment integration seam. Provider-specific logic stays behind this adapter; the checkout code
only knows the order's payment_status (pending · paid · failed · refunded · cancelled).

Today no provider is connected (P3_PAYMENT_PROVIDER=none): an order is created with payment
"pending" and says so plainly — a successful payment is NEVER faked. A real provider (hosted or
tokenised form, so card details never reach XJet) plugs in here with Begin()/Confirm() and the
webhook route can call Confirm() without touching the checkout flow.
